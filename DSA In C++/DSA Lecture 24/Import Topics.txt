Import Topics:-

(1)Pigeonhole Theory:-
if you have more items than containers, then at least one container must have more than one item.

Ex:-
• If you have 6 socks and 5 drawers, at least one drawer will have two socks. 
• If you have 10 people and 9 birthday months, at least two people share the same birthday month. 
• If you have 5 pigeons and 4 pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole will have more than one pigeon. 


(2)Catalan numbers:-
sequence of positive integers that appear in many combinatorial problems.

Ex:-
• 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, ...

Formula for Catalan numbers:-
C(n)=(2n)!/(n+1)!
